In Athens, Greece, a young man, Demetrius, has a problem.
‘Please, Hermia. I love you!’
‘No, Demetrius. I love Lysander!’
‘Love is never easy! Let’s run away together!’
Helena is Hermia’s friend. She loves Demetrius.
‘Demetrius, you know Hermia is running away to the forest with Lysander ...’
‘I’m going to follow them.’
‘Well, I’m going to follow you.’
In the forest, the fairy king Oberon wants to play a trick on Titania, his queen.
‘Go and find a magic flower! I’ll put the juice in your eyes. It will make you fall in love
with the first thing you see.’
Oberon sees Demetrius and Helena. He doesn’t like the way Demetrius talks to Helena.
‘Helena, go away! I don’t like you!’
‘Puck! Put this on Demetrius’s eyes so he will fall in love with Helena!’
Puck sees Lysander sleeping, and thinks it is Demetrius. Lysander wakes up and sees
Helena.
‘Helena, I love you!’
He doesn’t love Hermia any more!
A group of actors are in the forest, practising their play. Puck plays a trick on them
and changes Bottom’s head into a donkey’s. Naughty Puck!
‘What’s wrong? Hee-haw, hee-haw.’
‘Hee-haw, hee-haw.’
Titania falls in love with Bottom!
Oberon knows Puck put the juice on Lysander, not Demetrius, so he makes Demetrius
fall in love with Helena.
‘Helena, I love you!’
‘No, I love Helena!’
Lysander and Demetrius want to fight over Helena.
‘Why does no one love me?’
Oberon tells Puck to make a magic fog to put them all to sleep. Puck takes the love
spell away from Lysander.
Next Puck gives Bottom his human head again. Oberon takes the love spell away from
Titania.
In the morning, everybody wakes up.
‘I love you, Helena!’
‘I love you too, Demetrius!’
‘I love you, Hermia!’
‘I love you too, Lysander!’
Nobody remembers what happened! But now everybody is in love with the right
person, they decide to go home. Perhaps it was all just a dream!
