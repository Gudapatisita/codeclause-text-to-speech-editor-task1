A Talkative Turtle called Tom lived in a lake, deep inside a forest. He would talk all day long with anyone- from tiny ants to giant elephants. 
But Tom liked to talk most with his best friends- a pair of geese, called Bo and Mo. The three friends lived in the same lake.
The three friends left the next morning. Tom was excited. He had lived all his life on the ground. Now he could see mountains from a height. 
Even the tall elephants looked tiny from the sky. He wanted to discuss all this with his friends. But remembering Mo's words, he kept his mouth shut.
