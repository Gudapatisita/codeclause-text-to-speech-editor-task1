In a faraway kingdom, there once lived a king who was known for his grandeur and humility. He had a loving and adorable queen. The king had a magnificent palace, loaded with royal commodities. 
His bed was soft as cotton, the sheets were impeccably white and smooth as silk, his room smelled of freshly blooming flowers, yet the king complained of not getting a good sleep at night.
One day the queen thought of getting a new crown for herself. She had ordered the crown to be loaded with precious jewels. So she was busy all day shopping for her new crown. 
Merchants and traders came from distant lands to offer their best jewels to the queen. So she was busy shopping for her stone-studded crown all day long. The king stayed back at the palace the whole day.
