Once upon a time, in a village on the banks of the Ganges, there lived a priest and his wife. They led a simple life and were very devoted to God. 
After many years of marriage, the priest and his wife were still childless. In every prayer, they wished to have a child. 
Though the priest was bestowed with magical powers, none of his powers could help them bear a child.One day when the priest was praying in the Ganges, 
with his arms stretched open, he felt something on his palms. It was a mouse. It had appeared out of the thin air. When he looked up he saw an eagle and knew that it had dropped the mouse off its beak. 
He thought that it must be God’s gift and turned it into a beautiful little girl by chanting some ‘mantras’.
