A big, black hungry crow was flying around hunting for food one bright morning. She found a large slice of chicken on the ground. 
She took it in his beak and  flew to a nearby tree and sat on a branch. She was eager to eat it.A passing fox noticed the crow sitting on the tree with the food in his beak.
Since this fox was hungry, he thought to himself, "Mmmmm. That chicken looks delicious. I need to find a plan for getting it from the crow."
"Oh crow, you are the most gracious and beautiful bird I have ever seen!" said the fox as he approached the tree and stood in front of the Crow. "You're looking beautiful today. 
Your feathers are shining and bright. You have the look of being the queen of all the birds."
